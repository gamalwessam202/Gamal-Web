                <h2>GAMAL WESSAM</h2>
                <p>As a web developer, UI designer,
                    and web designer, I have 
                    a diverse range of skills and 
                    expertise that allow me to
                    create engaging and effective
                    web experiences. With 
                    experience in both design and 
                    development, I am able to bridge
                    the gap between the two
                    disciplines and create visually 
                    appealing designs that are also
                    functional and user-friendly, I have experience building
                    websites and applications using a range of programming languages and 
                    development frameworks, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. I am skilled 
                    in creating responsive designs that can adapt to different screen sizes, and I 
                    have experience working with databases like MySQL to create dynamic web 
                    applications. Overall, my experience as a web developer, UI designer, and 
                    web designer makes me a valuable asset to any team working on a web project.</p>

                <p>Mobile responsiveness: With more and more people accessing
                    the internet on mobile devices, itâ€™s essential to ensure
                    that your website is mobile-friendly and responsive. This
                    means that it should be optimized for smaller screens and
                    touch-based navigation.</p>

                    preferences is crucial to creating a design that meets their expectations.Wireframing
                    :Creating a wireframe is an important step in the design process. It
                    allows designers to create a basic layout and structure of the
                    interface before adding visual element Prototyping: Creating
                    a prototype allows designers to test the interface and make 
                    necessary changes before.</p>
